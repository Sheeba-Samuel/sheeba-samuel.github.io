                                    <p class="card-text">The REPRODUCE-ME Data Model is a generic data model for the
                                        representation of
                                        scientific experiments with their provenance information.
                                        The aim of this model is to capture the general elements of scientific
                                        experiments for their
                                        understandability and reproducibility.
                                        An Experiment is considered as the central point of the REPRODUCE-ME data model.
                                        The model consists of eight
                                        components: Data, Agent, Activity, Plan, Step,
                                        Setting, Instrument, Material. The REPRODUCE-ME Data Model forms a basis for the
                                        REPRODUCE-ME ontology.
                                        The REPRODUCE-ME ontology extended from PROV-O and P-Plan is used to represent
                                        the whole picture of an
                                        experiment describing the path it took from its design to result.
                                        We aim to enable end-to-end reproducibility of scientific experiments by
                                        capturing and representing
                                        the complete provenance of a scientific experiment using the REPRODUCE-ME
                                        ontology.

                                        It also allows the user to share a notebook along with its provenance in RDF and
                                        also convert it back to a
                                        notebook.
                                        We use the REPRODUCE-ME ontology extended from PROV-O and P-Plan to describe the
                                        provenance of a notebook.
                                        This helps the scientists to compare their previous results with the current
                                        ones, check whether the
                                        experiments produce the results as expected and query the sequence of executions
                                        using SPARQL.
                                        The notebook data in RDF can be used in combination with the experiments that
                                        used them and help to get a
                                        track of the complete path of the scientific experiments.</p>

                                        in reproducing
                                        published results, is currently faced by several disciplines.
                                        To understand the underlying problem in the context of the reproducibility
                                        crisis, it is important to first
                                        know the different research practices followed in their domain and the factors
                                        that hinder reproducibility.
                                        We performed an exploratory study by conducting a survey addressed to
                                        researchers representing a range of
                                        disciplines to understand scientific experiments and research practices for
                                        reproducibility.
                                        The survey findings identify a reproducibility crisis and a strong need for
                                        sharing data, code, methods,
                                        steps, and negative and positive results.
                                        Insufficient metadata, lack of publicly available data, and incomplete
                                        information in study methods are
                                        considered to be the main reasons for poor reproducibility.
                                        The survey results also address a wide number of research questions on the
                                        reproducibility of scientific
                                        results.</p>

                                        reproducible, those that
                                        resulted in exceptions, those with different results from the original
                                        notebooks, etc.
                                        Each notebook in the repository along with the provenance information of its
                                        execution can also be exported
                                        in RDF with the integration of the ProvBook tool.

                                        with its documentation and output in one interactive environment, and they
                                        represent a popular mechanism to document and share computational workflows. The
                                        reproducibility of computational aspects of research is a key component of
                                        scientific reproducibility but has not yet been assessed at scale for Jupyter
                                        notebooks associated with biomedical publications. We address computational
                                        reproducibility at two levels: First, using fully automated workflows, we
                                        analyzed the computational reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks related to
                                        publications indexed in PubMed Central. We identified such notebooks by mining
                                        the articles full text, locating them on GitHub and re-running them in an
                                        environment as close to the original as possible. We documented reproduction
                                        success and exceptions and explored relationships between notebook
                                        reproducibility and variables related to the notebooks or publications. Second,
                                        this study represents a reproducibility attempt in and of itself, using
                                        essentially the same methodology twice on PubMed Central over two years. Out of
                                        27271 notebooks from 2660 GitHub repositories associated with 3467 articles,
                                        22578 notebooks were written in Python, including 15817 that had their
                                        dependencies declared in standard requirement files and that we attempted to
                                        re-run automatically. For 10388 of these, all declared dependencies could be
                                        installed successfully, and we re-ran them to assess reproducibility. Of these,
                                        1203 notebooks ran through without any errors, including 879 that produced
                                        results identical to those reported in the original notebook and 324 for which
                                        our results differed from the originally reported ones. Running the other
                                        notebooks resulted in exceptions. We zoom in on common problems, highlight
                                        trends and discuss potential improvements to Jupyter-related workflows
                                        associated with biomedical publications.
